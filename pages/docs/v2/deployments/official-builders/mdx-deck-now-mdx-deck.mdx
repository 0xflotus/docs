}

Create [mdx-deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck) decks with ease.

This builder is similar to [`@now/static-build`](/docs/v2/deployments/official-builders/static-build-now-static-build), but instead of having to write a `package.json` file, it receives a `.mdx` file directly as an entrypoint, which it builds into a `index.html`, `main.js` and `main.html` files.

## When to use it

When you need to quickly create a deck with no ceremony, configuration or custom npm packages.

## How to use it

Define a `index.mdx` file with the following contents:

```
My slide
---
My second slide
---
My third slide
```

Then define the build inside `now.json`:

```
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    { "src": "index.mdx", "use": "@now/mdx-deck" }
  ]
}
```

Your resulting deck is statically built and served from our CDN: https://mdx-deck-deployment-714egk6ff.now.sh

## Technical details

### Entrypoint

The entrypoint is always a `.mdx` file that follows the [mdx-deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck) format.
