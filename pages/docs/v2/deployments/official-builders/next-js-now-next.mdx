    'The official Next.js Builder for ZEIT Now. Deploy Next.js applications with ease.'
}

<Tag>Status: Beta</Tag>

This builder takes a Next.js application, defined as `pages`, `next.config.js` and optionally a `package.json` file (with `next`, `react`, `react-dom`, etc), and converts them into a series of individual [Lambdas](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas).

It features built-in caching of `node_modules` and all the compiler artifacts for very fast deployments.

## When to use it

`@now/next` is the ideal way to ship a fast, production-ready Next.js application that scales automatically.

## How to use it

Create a `pages` directory with some example pages, for example `pages/index.js`:

```jsx
export default () => <div>Hello world!</div>
```

For this example, we won't define a `package.json` with our dependencies. We'll let the builder automatically install them. We'll create a simple `next.config.js` file to use as our entrypoint for the build

```js
module.exports = () => ({})
```

Then we'll define our build step in `now.json`:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [{ "src": "next.config.js", "use": "@now/next" }]
}
```

Upon deployment, we'll get a URL like this: https://next-js-deployment-kbbzal0ha.now.sh/

## Technical Details

### Entrypoint

The entrypoint of this builder is a `next.config.js` file or a `package.json` file.

### Dependencies installation

The installation algorithm of dependencies works as follows:

- If a `package-lock.json` is present, `npm install` is used
- Otherwise, `yarn` is used.

### Private npm modules

To install private npm modules, define `NPM_TOKEN` as a [build environment](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration#build.env) in `now.json`.

### Node.js version

The Node.js version used is the latest in the **8 branch**.

### Custom Server

This builder seperates your pages into individual serverless endpoints, so you cannot use a custom server.

Using a custom server would require that all pages be routed through that custom server and the application would lose out on many of the benefits of [serverless](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas/) Next.js. You can still achieve most of the logic that you have in a custom server by using [getInitialProps()](https://nextjs.org/docs/#fetching-data-and-component-lifecycle) and using [routes](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration/#routes).

### Maximum Lambda Bundle Size

To help keep cold boot times low, the [maximum output bundle size](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas#maximum-bundle-size) for a Next.js output lambda is, by default, **`5mb`**.
This [limit is extendable](/docs/v2/deployments/builders/overview#configuring-output-lambda-size) up to **`50mb`**.

<Example>
  <span>
    Example <InlineCode>maxLambdaSize</InlineCode> configuration:
  </span>
  <Code lang="json">{`{
  "builds": [
    { "src": "next.config.js", "use": "@now/next", "config": { "maxLambdaSize": "10mb" } }
  ]
}`}</Code>
