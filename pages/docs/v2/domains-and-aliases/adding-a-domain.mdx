With Now, you can alias your deployments to a custom name, whether that is a free `.now.sh` prefixed domain or your personal domain. This document will explain how to add your domain to Now so that you can alias your deployments to it.

With ZEIT, you can either:

- [Buy a domain to use, with automatic setup](#buying-a-domain-with-zeit)
- [Add and configure an existing domain from another provider](#adding-your-domain-to-now)

## Buying a Domain with ZEIT

If you want a brand new domain to use with your Now deployments, you can buy one directly from Now and have it setup automatically on your account without any further need of setup.

When buying a domain, it may take a few minutes to setup and propagate before it is ready to use. In this time, the domain will show as external when you see it in Now CLI or from the Web UI.

### From the Web

Using the [ZEIT domains page](/domains) you can search for an available domain and then add it to your account in an instant. The domain will automatically be setup, ready for you to alias your deployments to.

Once the domain is bought, it will automatically be verified (this may take a few minutes) and available for you to alias your deployments.

You can see your domain in your account by using the `now domains ls` command or checking the setup status by using the `now domains inspect` command.

## Adding Your Domain To Now

### Step 1: Adding and Verifying

If you already own a domain outside of ZEIT, you can add it to your account with the `now domains add` command.

When using this command, Now CLI will give you instructions of how to verify the domain so that you can access your Now deployments and DNS records through your domain.

When verifying a domain, you will have two options to choose from. Either using ZEIT DNS nameservers or using a TXT DNS record.

Note: To migrate with no downtime, follow our [Zero-Downtime Migration to ZEIT DNS Guide](/docs/v2/domains-and-aliases/zero-downtime-domain-migration).

#### Option 1: Using ZEIT DNS Nameservers

When adding a domain with ZEIT, Now CLI will give you an intended set of nameservers that can be set with your domain name provider to point to ZEIT DNS so that you can access your deployments from that domain.

Using the ZEIT DNS nameservers is the preferred way of verifying and pointing your domain towards Now since it allows us to generate DNS records automatically that help with managing your domain.

With this method, you are also enabled to generate wildcard certificates automatically.

The nameservers you are provided with are randomly given to enhance [stability and security](#stability-and-security) when setting up your domain.

Once you have added the provided nameservers, you can [verify your domain](#verifying-the-domain).

#### Option 2: Using a TXT DNS record

Along with the set of intended nameservers, you will also be provided with a `TXT` record including a `name` (also known as `host` or `alias`) and a `value`.

Adding this record with your domain provider to your domain will allow Now to verify that the domain belongs to you and enable to control your domain.

This method is recommended when you want a [zero-downtime migration](/docs/v2/domains-and-aliases/zero-downtime-domain-migration) before [pointing your domain to Now](#step-2:-pointing-to-now).

#### Verifying the Domain

Now will automatically check the added domain for the suggested verification methods, and when detected, the domain will be marked as verified.

You can force Now to check for verification by using the `now domains verify` command:

<TerminalInput>{`now domains verify <domain>`}</TerminalInput>

### Step 2: Pointing to Now

If you verified your domain with nameservers, this set is un-necessary since your domain will be already pointing to Now.

#### With Nameservers

To point to Now with nameservers, if not already done so, for example when you verified with a TXT record for a [zero-downtime migration](/docs/v2/domains-and-aliases/zero-downtime-domain-migration), you can find the intended set of nameservers for your domain by running the inspect command:

<TerminalInput>{`now domains inspect <domain>`}</TerminalInput>

This command will print your current and intended nameservers.

Once you change the nameservers with your domain provider and the domain propagates; your domain will point to Now and you can access your deployments from that domain.

The benefits of using nameservers include:

- Wildcard certificate generation
- Automatic DNS management
- Easy DNS management

Using this method means that you will be using ZEIT DNS and your domain will be marked as a ZEIT DNS or [zeit.world](/dns) domain.

#### With CNAME

If you need to use a CNAME to point to Now, you can do so after [TXT verification](#option-2:-using-a-txt-dns-record) by creating one with your domain provider with the value of `alias.zeit.co`.

Using this method means that you will not be using ZEIT DNS and your domain will be marked as external.

For a greater advantage with Now and your domain, we strongly recommend using the [nameservers method](#option-1:-using-zeit-dns-nameservers).

### Step 3: Using Your Domain

Now that your domain is verified and pointing to Now, you are free to:

- [Alias deployments](/docs/v2/domains-and-aliases/aliasing-a-deployment) to the domain
- [Create DNS records](/docs/v2/domains-and-aliases/dns) for the domain
- [Generate certificates](/docs/v2/domains-and-aliases/zero-downtime-domain-migration) for the domain

Both of these methods are handled automatically if [using nameservers](#option-1:-using-zeit-dns-nameservers).

## Managing Your Domain with Now CLI

The following list of commands can be used with Now CLI

### Listing Your Account or Team's Domains

Using the following command, you can list all added domains under the current context, whether it is your account or a team.

<TerminalInput>{`now domains ls`}</TerminalInput>

### Inspecting A Domain

To get information about your domain from Now, you can use the `now domains inspect` command.

With this command, you can see:

- If your domain is external or using ZEIT DNS.
- When your domain was verified by either TXT record or nameservers.
- The expiry date and when it was bought (if bought with ZEIT).
- If the CDN is enabled.
- If it has a Custom Deployment Suffix assigned.
- How many aliases are assigned with the domain.
- How many certificates the domain has.

<TerminalInput>{`now domains inspect <domain>`}</TerminalInput>

### Adding a Domain

With the following command, you can assign a domain you already own to your ZEIT account or team:

<TerminalInput>{`now domains add <domain>`}</TerminalInput>

### Removing a Domain

With the following command you can remove a domain that is assigned to your ZEIT account or team:

<TerminalInput>{`now domains rm <domain>`}</TerminalInput>

### Buying a Domain

With the following command you can buy a domain with Now:

<TerminalInput>{`now domains buy <domain>`}</TerminalInput>

### Verifying a Domain

With the following command you can force Now to check that your domain is verified by either TXT or Nameservers:

<TerminalInput>{`now domains verify <domain>`}</TerminalInput>

## Transferring a Domain to Another Account

If you want to transfer a domain from one account to another, to a team, or from a team, you are able to do so by first removing the domain from the current account or team and then adding it to the intended account or team.

## Stability and Security

When adding a domain to an account or team, before verifying, Now will provide the intended nameservers for your domain to use. These nameservers are chosen at random to prevent timing attacks where a third-party monitors changes to a domain's nameservers and then attempts to add the domain to their Now account.

This process, however, will require another verification step to be completed.

## FAQ

### Can I point the nameservers of a ZEIT bought domain to another service?

Currently this is not possible but there is active progress in making this possible.

### What is the different between a ZEIT DNS (or zeit.world) domain and an external domain?

As explained in the "[pointing to Now](#step-2:-pointing-to-now)" section:

- ZEIT DNS domains are those that point to the ZEIT DNS nameservers, which allows Now to have greater control and therefore making it easier to automatically manage the domain.
- External domains are those that point to ZEIT through a CNAME record and are harder for Now to automatically manage.

### Can I transfer a domain to another account or team without needing to verify again?

A tool for transferring domains between accounts is in the works and will bypass this need.

## Using Domains

With a domain added and enabled under an account or team, the next step is to alias a deployment to that domain.
